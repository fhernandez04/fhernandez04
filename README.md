# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineering student passionate about problem-solving and efficient software design. What motivates me the most is not just learning new programming languages but developing an engineering mindset to structure and optimize software systems. I am particularly interested in algorithms, architecture, and scalable software design.

From my early experiences in League of Codes with C++ to my studies at the University of Granada (UGR), I have had the opportunity to strengthen my knowledge in software engineering, deepening my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and system design. During this stage, I not only acquired a solid technical foundation but also developed an analytical approach to tackling complex problems in a structured way.

To broaden my horizons, I pursued an exchange program at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I had the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies and advanced methodologies, as well as connect with professionals in the field at an international level. This experience has given me a global perspective on software development and its application in real-world environments.

I am currently looking for opportunities to further develop my skills in the software industry. I am eager to work in collaborative environments where I can continue learning and adding value.
